			<summary id="5.1 - Build the project">5.1 - Build the project</summary>
			<p>There are two methods of building a project.<br>
				We can explicitly <b>[Right-Click]</b> a project and click <b>Build Project</b><br></p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/rightclickbuild.gif">

			<p>Or we can build the currently active (selected) project by clicking on the build icon.<br></p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/defaultbuild.gif">
			<p>In both animations above the builds success was verified in the consol window, by analysing the build
				output.<br><br>

				<b>Importantly</b> if you <b>do not</b> have the RL78/G23 128p FPB hardware then you must perform
				the following:<br>
				<b>[Right-Click] Project &rarr; Build Configurations &rarr; Set Active &rarr; Debug (Debug using GDB
					simulator)</b><br>
				This changes the build type to target the simulator instead of target based hardware debugging.<br>
				If you <b>do</b> have the RL78/G23 128p FPB hardware then you do not need to perform this extra
				step.

			<summary id="5.2 - Build Options">5.2 - Build Options</summary>
			<p>Build options such as optimisations, compiler lookup paths, linker settings etc. can be found by
				<b>[Right-Click] Project &rarr; Properties &rarr; C/C++ Build &rarr; Settings</b><br>
			</p>
			<img class="modal-thumbnails" src="img/img_lab/buildoptions.gif">
			<p>From here all build options are available such as; compiler, assembler & linker flags, pre/post
				build command line steps, binary converter options and more.</p>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary id="5.3 - Build Configurations">5.3 - Build Configurations</summary>
			<p>What is a build configuration and how to change them, also by default one exists for each
				debug configuration.<br>
				Also <b>for every build configuration, all build output/intermediary files are stored in the
					folder with the build configuration name</b>.
				<br><br>
				A build configuration is, as the name implies, a specific set of build/make options for a
				given build type.<br>
				A typical example of this would be a "Debug" and a "Release" build - where for debugging you
				may want to disable all optimisations
				and enable certain compilation defines/macros whereas in release, we may want increased
				optimisation and for all debug code to
				be disabled (disable compilation defines/macros).<br>
				A developer can have as many build configurations as they wish for each project. When a
				project is built in a certain build configuration -
				all output files and intermediary files are placed in a subfolder of the project with the
				build configuration name.<br>
				The build configurations can be managed by <b>[Right-Click] Project &rarr; Build
					Configurations &rarr; Manage...</b>.<br>
				The build options described in step 5.2 can be applied to one or all build configurations by
				using the dropdown menu at the top of the properties dialog, like so:<br>
